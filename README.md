# Hello-World
I am a hobbiest who wants to make new programs similar to some origionals like the .io games e.g. Agar.io and Diep.io for schools, meaning that they won't be blocked, and I will continue to do this until schools get a bit of common sense about what they block.
I am going to vlog once ar twice a week on the vlog branch (to be made), so do keep an eye.
I will make regular updates to what I do, so please give support.
:)
